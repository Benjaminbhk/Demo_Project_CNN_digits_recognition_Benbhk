## This project is a demonstration. It uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to recognize a number. The interface is coded with Streamlit (framework). The project is available online on two platforms:
- it has been put online on GCP (Container Registry and Cloud Run) - longer launch
- it has been put online on Heroku (directly from Github) - faster launch
